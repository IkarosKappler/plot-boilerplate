These 'vanilla' classes are here just here for nostalgic reasons, because they were
the early stage package that was just directly coded in pure Javascript.

THE CLASSES IN THIS FOLDER ARE NO LONGER MAINTAINED.

Please use the new ones which are written in Typescript (in the ./src/ts folder) or
the transpiled one (in the ./src/js folder).

Or take the whole bundle from ./dist/.

Have fun.
